            <h3>Summary:</h3>
            <p>You are looking at the historic Foxton Staircase Locks and the remains of the remarkable Inclined Plane
                boat lift, once a marvel of Victorian engineering. To your right stands the boiler house, its tall
                chimney a remnant of the steam age that powered the lift. Above it is the Engine and Cable House. Built
                in 1900, the lift transported canal boats up and down the steep hillside in giant tanks, saving time and
                water. Though dismantled in the 1920s, its legacy remains. Imagine the clatter of machinery, the hiss of
                steam, and the bustle of canal life that once echoed across this tranquil Leicestershire landscape.</p>
